# üìß Email Spam Detection

This project focuses on **detecting whether an email is spam or not** using machine learning techniques. The goal is to build an accurate and reliable model that can help users automatically filter unwanted emails and improve email management.

## üîç Project Overview

Spam emails are a common problem, causing wasted time and potential security risks. This project uses a dataset containing various email features to classify emails as spam or not. The workflow includes preprocessing, analysis, feature engineering, modeling, and a user-friendly GUI for real-world usability.

## üõ†Ô∏è Data Preprocessing

To prepare the data for machine learning, the following steps were performed:

- **Handling missing values:** Cleaned and imputed missing or inconsistent data.  
- **Encoding categorical variables:** Converted textual or categorical features into numeric formats suitable for ML algorithms.  
- **Feature scaling:** Standardized numerical features to improve model convergence and performance.  
- **Balancing the dataset:** Addressed class imbalance to prevent biased predictions towards non-spam emails.

## üìä Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA was conducted to understand the dataset and uncover important patterns:

- Visualizations of feature distributions and spam vs. non-spam emails  
- Analysis of correlations between features and spam likelihood  
- Insights into the key indicators that distinguish spam from legitimate emails  

---

## üß© Feature Engineering

- Created meaningful features to improve model performance  
- Selected the most relevant features to reduce noise and enhance classification accuracy

## ü§ñ Machine Learning Models

Multiple machine learning models were trained and evaluated to identify the best classifier:

- Logistic Regression  
- Random Forest Classifier  
- Gradient Boosting / XGBoost  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- Naive Bayes  

Each model was optimized and compared to ensure the highest predictive performance.

## üìà Model Evaluation

Models were assessed using standard classification metrics:

- **Accuracy:** Overall correctness of predictions  
- **Precision:** How many predicted spam emails are actually spam  
- **Recall:** How well the model identifies actual spam emails  
- **F1-Score:** Balance between precision and recall  
- **Confusion Matrix:** Visual representation of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives  

The best-performing model was selected based on a combination of these metrics.

## üñ•Ô∏è GUI Implementation

A user-friendly graphical interface was created to allow users to input emails and receive instant spam classification results. The GUI demonstrates the practical usability of the model and enhances the overall experience.
